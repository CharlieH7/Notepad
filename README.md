# Notepad
Developed a notepad using C# Windows Form with a basic offline user login. It is a windows application that will allow new users to be added, existing users to login, and to create/save/edit text documents.

1. To run the application go to Assignment2/bin/Debug/net6.0-windows/Assignment2.exe. Alternatively download the whole folder and open the solutino file in visual studio and run the application.
2. Login credentials can be found in the same folder as above called login.txt
